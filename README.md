<li>QUESTION: How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
<br>
<br>
ANSWER: The way that I write programs that follow the industry standard is by gettring a firm understanding of the exact requirments then from here I begin to design my code to be readable, maintainable, and adaptable; to do so I use comments, unique names throught out my code, and follow the SOLID principles to allow for easy updates.

<li>QUESTION: How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
<br>
<br>
ANSWER: Typically while coding I follow Test Driven Development (TDD) but for majority of this class I was not anle to do so as the tests were not always needed and to do majority of the assignments for CS340 TDD was not plausible using MongoDB. So my approach to solving issues in this class would be based off of working knowledge and if I was not clear on a subject I would research it using the resources provided each week.

<li>QUESTION: What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
<br>
<br>
ANSWER: Simple enough computer scientists solve problems in their jobs. This project we were tasked with creating a interactive dashboard to better the company so users of this application can see data about dogs in shelters around Austin, Tx. Solving problems as a computer scientist is important as we are trained to think outside of the box and our sole job is to  make the experience better for those around us.
